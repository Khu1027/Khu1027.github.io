Welcome to my new coding blog! 
As the first blog post I thought it was only appropriate to explain step-by-step how I made my own website/blog and hosted it using GitHub's free hosting service, GitHub Pages, for free!

## What is GitHub Pages?

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free hosting service that allows GitHub users to create and host their own unique website for free! Files are taken straight from your repository on GitHub and deployed automatically whenever you push to the repo

## Why should you use GitHub Pages? (compared to other hosting platforms)

- First of all, its **FREE** <br/>
    Any person familiar to hosting applications and websites should know what a nightmare it is to host their site online cheaply or for free. 
- Secondly, its **easy** <br/>
    It is not an exaggeration to say that you can make a basic website on GitHub pages in _minutes_. The ease of use is incredible. _But_ you may experience some hiccups when you first get started, so I'm here to make it just a bit easier for you :)
- Last but not least, it is connected directly to your **GitHub account** <br/>
    Programmers and coding enthusiasts would be glad to know that everything is integrated to your GitHub account. Your website is automatically updated whenever you push to your repository :D
- And many other features I have yet to discover!
