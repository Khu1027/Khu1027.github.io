Hello! My name is Khulood Ahmad, a university student and robotics enthusiast :D

### What is this blog for?

Hopefully to do and present some code (lets see how that goes)
- A couple of small coding projects perhaps
- Maybe a blog post or two on things I find interesting
- <del>A production diary of a visual novel? </del>
- Hell its summer, lets try and do them all :]
